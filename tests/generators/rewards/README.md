# Rewards

Rewards covers the sub-functions of `process_rewards_and_penalties` for granular testing of components of the rewards function.

A rewards test-runner can consume these sub-transition test-suites,
 and handle different kinds of epoch sub-transitions by processing the cases using the specified test handler.

Information on the format of the tests can be found in the [rewards test formats documentation](../../formats/rewards/README.md).
